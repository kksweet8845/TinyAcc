# How to Use it
1. execute matmul.py to generate the test_case and define file
```shell
$ python matmul.py ./test_case/input1
```
2. The generated file will be located in build directory.

3. Use vivado to add source design, such as src/*.v, tpu.v, and build/matrix_define.v. Don't forget copying *.bin as well to working directory.
